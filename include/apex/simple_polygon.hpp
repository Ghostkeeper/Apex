 * A plane figure consisting of a single contour of straight line segments.
 *
 *
 * This is a closed shape, represented by a list of vertices in 2D. Between
 * every two adjacent vertices, as well as between the first and last vertices,
 * is an edge. These edges together form a closed shape that is the contents of
 * the simple polygon.
 *
 * Technically this class represents a "closed polygonal chain". This polygon
 * can only have one continuous surface and cannot have holes, since it is
 * simple. However contrary to actual simple polygons, this polygon is allowed
 * to self-intersect.
 *
 * The polygon does not publicly have a start or end point. However its data
 * model must start somewhere and iterating over the vertices must choose a
 * vertex to start and end at.
 *
 * If the vertices of the polygon are winding counter-clockwise, the polygon is
 * positive. Otherwise it is negative.
