	 * Run a benchmark with various size inputs.
	 *
	 * The benchmarked function takes a reference to test data as input. This
	 * function will be provided with various size inputs, generated through the
	 * generator provided.
	 *
	 * Each size in the given size list will first be run once as a warm-up
	 * round. This causes memory to be pre-allocated for the application so that
	 * the performance of the operating system memory allocation influences the
	 * measurements less. After that, they will be executed for real and the
	 * duration will be measured. The real test is repeated a number of times,
	 * defined by \ref repeats.
	 *
	 * The benchmarked function may not alter the input data in this version.
	 * To benchmark functions that do alter the input data, the data would have
	 * to be re-generated at every test.
	 *
	 * The outcome for each size is returned as a vector whose indices match the
	 * indices of the various sizes given in the input size array.
	 * \tparam TestData A testing object provided for the benchmarked function,
	 * which is also the output of the generator.
	 * \param name A name to display in the terminal while this benchmark is
	 * running.
	 * \param generator A generator that generates test data objects with a
	 * certain size. The generator is a function that gets a size and needs to
	 * return a test object with that size.
	 * \param sizes A list of sizes to test with.
	 * \param benchmark A function to test the performance of. The function
	 * needs to accept a reference to a test object (as returned by the
	 * generator). It then needs to perform a task on that test object, and
	 * \emph only that task. Do not include any set-up or tear-down into this
	 * function. The benchmarked function will be measured as a whole for its
	 * performance.
	 * \return A vector of average execution times, equal to the length of the
	 * sizes given. This vector contains the average execution time of the
	 * benchmarked function given each size input. Execution times is in
	 * nanoseconds.
